```{r setup, include=FALSE}

Ordering and shuffling:
I recently found that you can order a dataframe based on a list or vector.
```{r}
# can be used on a list
x <- c(1,3,5,6,7,5,4,3,2,4,5,8,9,0)
x[order(x)]

```
or
```{r}
# can be used on a dataframe
x <- c(1,3,5,6,7,5,4,3,2,4,5,8,9,0,44)
y <- c(1:15)
df <- data.frame(x,y)
ordered-df <- df[order(x),]
```
